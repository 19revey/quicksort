sphcode/sph:  with cpu neighbor searching

sphcode/sphcuda: gpu neighbor searching (Makefile is specified for OS X 10.9.5, cuda 7.5, code has also been tested under Ubuntu 14.04LTS, NVIDIA graphic card is required)



sphcode/sphcuda/ : cudasort.cu is  supposed to bin particles into cells with a spatial sequence, then perform 3D neighbor searching. 
syms.h defines the system parameter. particle.h defines the sph fluid class.
